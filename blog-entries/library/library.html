    <h1 id="main"><span class="highlight">The Great Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh Adventure</span> </h1>
    I've lived in Pittsburgh for about 2 years at the time of writing, and like any self-respecting
    Computer Science major, I've spent the vast majority of that time inside. That is, until I learned
    a few days ago about the wonders of the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh and their Passport system.
    When you get a library card at the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh (CLP), they give you a "CLP passport" -
    a passport in which you can keep track of the libraries you've visited marked with a large stamp, much
    like the ones on a regular passport. Immediately, I was fascinated by this, and the little gamer inside
    my head was urging me to "100%" the passport and visit every library (I had to talk myself out of speedrunning it,
    more on that later).
    On this page I plan to keep updated my journey across Pittsburgh's libraries, complete with blurbs about progress.
    The only rule I'm
    enforcing is that I may only travel to libraries via public transportation. Let the Great Carnegie Library of
    Pittsburgh Adventure Commence!

                    A really fantastic library! It has really great, cozy vibes once you get past the entrance
                    up a bunch of stairs which seems like they might be being rennovated. The building itself is
                    a really great piece of architecture and is a notable landmark on the bus ride from CMU so I never
                    miss my Squirrel Hill stop. The library itself has a great collection of books and multimedia.
                    I really appreciated the little displays they put up for notable books/genres. They had a Teenspace
                    - I dared not step into to preserve its teenage sanctity - which had graphics on the window of
                    my three favorite things from when I was a teenager: a yellow monster, pizza, and queer pride.
                    I hope the teenagers of Squirrel Hill make good use of this place! The children's section was
                    notably cute - I really appreciate them having computers dedicated for kids to use. I'm sure
                    some future CS major will have gotten their start from these computers and the intro programming
                    books nearby. And of course, shoutout to Nibbles to Squirrel.

                        Where better to start the journey than at the Main Library! (Conviniently also the closest by
                        distance)
                        It has everything you could possibly want in a library: tons of study space, books and other
                        media
                        to checkout galore,
                        a really nice coffee shop (I recommend the chocolate-banana muffin). The building itself is
                        gorgeous
                        - I like to go
                        to the second floor to study. Also, I ran into my friend Sasha when visiting for the first time,
                        so
                        that's a plus!
                        The only downside of this library is that the rooms are very echoey, so it's easy to
                        accidentally be
                        very loud and disturb
                        people when shuffling through a bag, for example. However, it's easily an S-tier library, highly
                        recommended.
