        Welcome to my music page! Here I'll link songs and projects that I've worked on
        sorted by style. None of it is on Spotify or anything, this is just for fun.

            <h2><span class="highlight"> SiIvaGunner Style Rips</span></h2>
            This are remixes and mashups of (mostly) video game and anime music.
            Most of them are categorically bad, but I think they're amusing. 
            They are largely (entirely) inspired by channels like
            <a class="highlightable link" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/SiIvaGunner/featured" target="_blank">SiIvaGunner</a>
            and
            <a class="highlightable link" href="https://chongomusic.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank">Chongo</a>.
            If you like these, I highly recommend checking them out!

                        I cannot tell you why, but this add is perhaps the funniest thing in the world to me, and mashing it up
                        into iconic songs from my childhood will ever not be funny to me.
