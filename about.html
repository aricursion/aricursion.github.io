        <p>Well, if you've made it this far you probably know I'm a CS student
        at CMU. (very much TBD but) I like the theory side of CS in particular
        type theory and everything and anything math-y. You can take a look at some of 
        my more notable projects below or read my blog for some cool math! (if you're
        reading this that um... doesn't exist yet but coming soon!)</p>
        <br>
        <p>Besides CS and math, I love music. While I'm not too good, I'm a self-taught
        guitar player and from time to time I dabble in remixes and other digital music.
        Check out some stuff I've done on my
        <a class="highlightable link" href="music.html" target="_blank">music</a>!
        page :D</p>

    <div class="program">
        <h1><span class="highlight"> Programming!</span></h1>
        <p> I've taken a look at a couple areas of programming from AI/ML
        to functional programming with dependent types. As of recently,
        I've been writing a lot of LEAN and working with automated theorem provers.</p>
        <br>
        <p>My favorite languages to work with as of right now are probably Rust, C, SML, and LEAN (in no particular order)</p>
        <br>
        <p> In the future, I really want to learn more dependently typed languages and on my todo list in particular
        are Scala and Agda </p>
        <br>
        <p> Most of my projects are on my

    <div class="music">
        <h1><span class="highlight"> Music!</span></h1>
        <p> I'm a self taught guitar play who likes to play a little bit of everything!
        As of right now, I play a lot of progressive metal and djent. My favorite guitarists
        are Tosin Abasi, Misha Mansoor, Tim Henson, and Mark Holcomb. Besides guitar, I dabble a bit
        in digital music primarily making remixes and SiIvaGunner style "rips" of video game music. It's silly,
        but I enjoy it. If you wanna check some of them out check out my

        <br>
        As an aside, I love sharing music I love with people I love! With that in mind, I've linked
        my
