            <p>Well, if you've made it this far you probably know I'm a CS student
                at CMU. I like the theory side of CS in particular
                type theory and everything and anything math-y. You can take a look at some of
                my more notable projects below or read my blog for some cool math!</p>
            <p>Besides CS and math, I love music. While I'm not too good, I'm a self-taught
                guitar player and from time to time I dabble in remixes and other digital music.
                Check out some stuff I've done on my

            <h1><span class="highlight"> Programming!</span></h1>
            <p> I've been programming since I was a wee lad - the age old tale of "I like video games! I want to make
                video games!"
                But over time I realized that there's so much more out there than just games, and most of it is way more
                interesting!
                I've taken a look at a couple areas of CS from AI/ML
                to functional programming with dependent types. I'm particularly interested in Formal Methods and am a
                bit of a
                type/category theory shill. As of recently,
                I've been writing a lot of Lean and working with interactive theorem provers. I'm also really interested
                in SAT and SMT solving.
            </p>
            <p>My favorite languages to work with as of right now are probably Rust and Lean 4.
                In the future, I really want to learn more dependently typed languages and on my todo list in particular
                are Scala and Agda.</p>
            <p> Most of my projects are on my
                <a class="highlightable link" href="http://github.com/zaxioms/" target="_blank">Github</a>.

        <div class="music">
            <h1><span class="highlight"> Music!</span></h1>
            <p> I'm a self taught guitar play who likes to play a little bit of everything!
                As of right now, I play a lot of progressive metal and djent. My favorite guitarists
                are Tosin Abasi, Misha Mansoor, Tim Henson, and Mark Holcomb. Besides guitar, I dabble a bit
                in digital music primarily making remixes and SiIvaGunner style "rips" of video game music. It's silly,
                but I enjoy it. If you wanna check some of them out check out my

                As an aside, I love sharing music I love with people I love! With that in mind, I've linked
